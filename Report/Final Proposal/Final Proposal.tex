    \begin{abstract}
        I proposed a field experiment on job banks in Taiwan to identify the characteristics of people applying for potentially fake 
        job opportunities online. The level of vulnerability can be measured by tracking ones' time interval of staying in our fake website. 
        Characteristics of the targets are provided anonymously by the job banks.
