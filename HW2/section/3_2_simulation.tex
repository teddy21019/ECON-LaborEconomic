\subsubsection{Example of $X_1$}

$X_1$ is the common factor for both outcomes which has the same marginal effect. In the example of migration, think of $X_1$ as the experience, which in both countries increases its wage in the same scale.

$\beta_1$ does not affect the choice of outcomes, but it equally affects both $w_0$ and $w_1$, therefore it can be identified by looking at the value of $w$. 


\subsubsection{Define the Propensity Score}

\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        w_0 &= \mu_0 + \beta_1 X_1  + \epsilon_0 \label{eq:w0} \\
        w_1 &= \mu_1 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon_1 \label{eq:w1}
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}

The propensity score is defined as

\begin{equation}
    \ps(x_1, x_2) = \Pr(\D = 1 \given X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2) \label{eq:roy_pscore}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Derive the Propensity Score}
Note that in Roy model, people choose $\D = 1$ if $w_1 > w_0 + C$, therefore

\begin{align*}
    \ps(x_1, x_2) &= \Pr(w_1 > w_0 + C) \\
    &= \Pr(\mu_1 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon_1 > \mu_0 + \beta_1 x_1  + \epsilon_0 + C) \\
    &= \Pr(\epsilon_0 - \epsilon_1 < 
        \mu_1 - \mu_0 + \beta_2 x_2 - C
    ) \\
    &= \Pr\left(
        \frac{\nu}{\sigma_\nu} < 
        \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_0 + \beta_2 x_2 - C}{\sigma_\nu}
        \right)
\end{align*}

Where $\nu \equiv \epsilon_0 - \epsilon_1$

\subsubsection{Theoretical Propensity Score}

Demonstrated in code. 

\subsubsection{Propensity Score from Logit}

Demonstrated in code.

\subsubsection{Correlation between Theoretical and Empirical Propensity Score}

The correlation coefficient in this simulation is $0.979$.

\subsubsection{Conduct IPW estimate}
We construct IPW estimate by dividing $w_0$ with $1-\ps(x)$ 
and $w_1$ with $\ps(x)$

The average treatment effect
$$
    \tau = \E(w_1 - w_0) = \E[\E(w_1 - w_0 \given X)] = \E(\mu_1 - \mu_0 + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon_1 - \epsilon_0)
$$
can then be estimated by
\begin{equation}
    \E\left( \frac{w\D}{\ps(X)} \right) - \E\left( \frac{w(1-\D)}{1 - \ps(X)} \right)
    = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left[
        \frac{d_i w_i}{\ps(x_i)} - \frac{(1-d_i) w_i}{1 - \ps(x_i)}
    \right]
\end{equation}

Do this for both the analytical propensity score and empirical propensity score, 
we have the estimated average treatment effect.

For the theoretical propensity score, I get -1.704; 
while for the empirical propensity score, I get 3.49
