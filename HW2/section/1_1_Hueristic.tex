\subsection{Heuristic Identification}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{“We don’t have enough sample size to identify the causal effects of the problem.”}

    The sample size doesn't effect the identification. Only the standard error of the estimation is effected.

    \item \emph{“We don’t have a good identification strategy so I need to use a structural model.”}
    
    Having a structural model does not guarantee the identification of its parameters.

    \item \emph{“Because I have a structural model, I don’t need to think about identification.”}
    
    Same as above, consider a structural model with two indistinguishable clusters. If the two clusters are the same, the identification of the parameters is impossible.

    \item \emph{“Because I can use the maximum likelihood estimator, I can identify that.”}
    
    Let's take a counterexample. Assume the maximum likelihood estimator that we constructed is flat around its global maximum (for some reason). The estimation is unidentified in this case.
