\subsection{Distribution of $F_U(U)$}

We consider the CDF of the CDF, that is, 
\begin{quote}
    How much of the U's will the CDF of U be less than y?
\end{quote}

Apparently this is exactly the definition of a CDF, hence this number is trivially $y$, and therefore we know
\begin{equation*}
    \Pr(F_U(U) \le y) = y
\end{equation*}, 
which is a uniform distribution between $[0,1]$


\subsection{$\ps(z) = F_U(v(z))$ 
\protect\footnote{I denote the propensity score as $\ps$.}}

The original definition of selection is 
\begin{equation*}
    D = \one (U \le v(Z) ) = \one (\tilde{U} \le F_U(v(Z)))
\end{equation*}
where $\tilde{U}\equiv F_U(U)$. 
This holds because CDF is a increasing function.

Therefore inside the propensity score we substitute $D=1$ with the condition
\begin{equation*}
    F_U(U) \le F_U(v(Z))
\end{equation*}

Hence
\begin{equation*}
    \ps(z) = \Pr(D=1 \given Z=z) = \Pr(F_U(U) \le F_U(v(Z)) \given Z=z) = \Pr(F_U(U) \le F_U(v(z)) )
\end{equation*}

Because $F_U(U)$ is uniformly distributed, we conclude that

\begin{equation*}
    \ps(z) = F_U(v(z))
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Show that $D = \one \{ \tilde{U} \le \ps(Z) \}$}

A direct substitution should do the work.
\begin{equation*}
    D = \one (U \le v(Z) ) = \one (\tilde{U} \le F_U(v(Z))) = \one (\tilde{U} \le p(Z))
\end{equation*}
